# Master's thesis R scripts and Jupyter notebooks 

This repository contains the R scripts and python notebooks used for the work of my master's thesis. 
The R scripts correspond to preprocessing of OpenFace and FaceReader data for each feature set used in the research. 
The Jupyter notebook has further preprocessing and all the model simulations.
